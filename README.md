## ðŸ“Œ About The Project

It features a user-friendly interface with user authentication, curriculum management, and an engaging presentation of the school's history. The website is designed to adapt across both desktop and mobile devices.

The website's contact form allows users to submit information like their name, email, and message, which is then sent to a designated API endpoint. 

Only logged-in users have access to the curriculum section. Upon successful login, the system allows users to access and view courses.

Additionally, the project emphasizes an attractive design that includes background video animations, interactive image galleries, and smooth animations.
